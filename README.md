braindead-ci
============

I couldn't find a hosted CI I like, so I'm making my own with Nodejs.
The goal is to make something super simple (you can see what I mean by
that with my other project [Mongo Edit](https://github.com/tldrio/mongo-edit))
and fast (i.e. unlike Jenkins for example).

For now, this only works for Nodejs projects, and is pretty ugly. I'll
improve it as I learn more about what it needs by using it in real life
(we use it in production at [tldr.io](http://tldr.io)). Still not ready
for prime time yet!
